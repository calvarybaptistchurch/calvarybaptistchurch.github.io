            <h2>Our Service Schedule</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Sunday School Discipleship - 9:30 am</h3>
            <p>Sunday School hour begins at 9:30 am and runs until 10:15 am with both adult and children's classes.  Come join us as we study the word of God together each Sunday morning.   We'd be honored to have you as our guest!</p>
            <h3>Sunday Morning Fellowship - 10:30 am</h3>
            <p>Sunday morning worship hour starts at 10:30 am (until 11:30 am). We sing praises and worship our risen Lord and Savior!  We conclude the hour with preaching while seeking together what God would have us to learn from His precious word.   Join us at 10:30 am this coming Sunday morning. </p>

            <h3>Noon Service</h3>
            <p>Due to the long distances many of our members travel, we have combined our evening service to follow shortly after the morning worship hour.   We typically start this second service around noon with a time of prayer and a brief message from God's Word. </p> 

            <h3>Sunday Fellowship and Refreshments</h3>
            <p>Between morning worship services and "evening" service, we join together in a time of fellowship, praises and snacks.  We would love to have you be our guest.  Come fellowship with us as we share a snack (or two). All are openly welcome to join us! </p>

            <p>Note: On the last Sunday of every month, we expand on our snack time into a good old fashion pot luck afternoon dinner.   There's always plenty of delicious home cooked food for our visitors too!    On this special day of fellowship, the "evening" service is often limited to testimonial times, a short challenge from the Word, special music, special speakers and/or singing.</p>

            <h3>Wednesday Bible Study - 7:00 pm</h3>
            <p>On Wednesday evenings, we gather for around an hour with an adult Bible study, Kids 4 Truth children's program, and a youth meeting for teens.</p>
