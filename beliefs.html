      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <hr>
          <p>As a church, it is our desire to stand strong on the clear doctrines of the Word of God so that we may please our Lord Jesus Christ, which is more important than pleasing anyone else. Here are some highlights of where we stand on issues of importance to the New Testament Church. If you would like more detailed information, please let us know.</p>

            <h3>Our Stand on The Holy Bible</h3>
            <p>We believe that the Bible is the divinely inspired, infallible, eternal and final word of God to man and is therefore authoritative and sufficient in its message.</p><p>(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20tim%203:16&version=KJV" target="new">I Timothy 3:16</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20pet%201:20-21&version=KJV" target="new">II Peter 1:20-21</a>) We have no creed, save the Bible. As a result of our reading and study of this Word of God we have certain outstanding conclusions.</p>
            <ul class="indent">
              <li>A regenerate church membership</li>
              <li>Believer's baptism by immersion</li>
              <li>The two ordinances (baptism and the Lord's Supper) are not sacraments but symbols which we participate in for the purpose of publicly identifying ourselves with Christ and His church and to remind ourselves of our privileges as children of God.</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Our Stand on God</h3>
            <p>We believe that God is Triune; that there are three persons in the Godhead, and these are one God (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:19&version=KJV" target="new">Matthew 28:19</a>).</p>
          <h3>Our Stand on Jesus Christ</h3>
            <p>Jesus Christ is Messiah and God. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He was crucified on the cruel cross of Calvary, He was buried, and praise God, He rose again - all this according to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>We also believe that our Lord Jesus Christ ascended to heaven and is now seated at the right hand of the Father; that He ever liveth to make intercession for all that come to God by him (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=heb%204:14&version=KJV" target="new">Hebrews 4:14</a>).</p>
            <p>We also believe that Christ may return at any moment in the air to rapture His Saints, and that a tribulation period of approximately seven years shall follow, after which He will come to earth with His Saints, and rule for a thousand years. After this the wicked will be judged and cast in to the Lake of Fire (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I%20Thessalonians%204:13-18&version=KJV" target="new">I Thessalonians 4:13-18</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I%20Corinthians%2015:51-57&version=KJV" target="new">I Corinthians 15:51-57</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%209:27&version=KJV" target="new">Daniel 9:27</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024:15-21&version=KJV" target="new">Matthew 24:15-21</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2019:11&version=KJV" target="new">Revelation 19:11</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2020:10-12&version=KJV" target="new">20:10-12</a>).</p>
          <h3>Our Stand on Salvation</h3>
            <p>We believe that the only way to be saved is by faith in the blood sacrifice, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and that those who thus become His sheep, He says, "I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." (John 10:28) We believe that salvation is of the Lord.</p>
          <h3>Our Stand on The Individual's Right To Approach God For Himself</h3>
            <p>"There is one mediator between God and man, Christ Jesus." (I Timothy 2:5)</p>

            <p>We believe that every individual must stand before God alone without any human props (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%209:27&version=KJV" target="new">Hebrews 9:27</a>).</p>

          <h3>Our Stand on the Equity of Believers</h3>
            <p>Christ is the Head and Lord of His Church. All of His ministers and servants are equal in rank (please read the books of Ephesians and Colossians).</p>

          <h3>Our Stand on Biblical Separation</h3>
            <p>We believe that God commands us to be holy, therefore the Christian is to live a life separated from the world unto God (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I%20John%202:15%20-17&version=KJV" target="new">I John 2:15 -17</a>).</p>
